          <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
            without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
          <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called
            "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate
            challenging
            sequences of moves.</p>

          routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. </p>
        <p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners and
            endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.</p>
